Hand Pose Recognition App
This React application leverages TensorFlow's Hand Pose Recognition model and React Webcam to track and visualize hand movements in real-time. Using advanced machine learning, the app detects and traces hand poses directly on the screen, providing an interactive experience for users. The app is built with React for seamless user interaction and TensorFlow.js for on-device pose estimation.
